An admin website for a fictitious Real Estate site demonstrating CRUD methods.

[Live Demo](https://ordinary-absorbing-sternum.glitch.me)

## Learning Objectives

- Practice CRUD methods and concepts
- Familiarize working with Mongoose and MongoDB
- Practice MVC concepts

## Notes

This project was done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) curriculum and is the [Inventory Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application) project. Main goal for this project was to practice CRUD concepts.

## Future Improvements

Project is incomplete. Completed paths for User and Home controllers but Account still needs to be finished. However, remaining work is essentially the same as what's been done already.

To be completed:

- Account update and delete functions
- Add a way to add and remove homes from accounts
- Haven't yet learned authentication but added a pw prompt for user form to protect updates. Can do the same for other routes.
- Add a view for "Our Houses" link showing all the database homes
